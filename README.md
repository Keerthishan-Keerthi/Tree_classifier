# ICT 3212 - Introduction to Intelligent Systems - tree classifier

## Project objective

The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple neural network architecture capable of classifying up to three tree species found in the university garden that are challenging to distinguish through visual observation.
## Project Components

### Dataset:
 - dataset of this neural network is uplaodaed herewith, under the name **datasheet_final.csv**
 - it is availabel in .csv file format

### code file:

-   python file containig whole workings including neural network is uploaded herewith under the name of **project_1.ipynb**
-   python file containig optimization workings of the finalized neural network is uploaded herewith under the name of **project_model_optimization.ipynb**
-   both files are available in the file format of Jupyter Source File (.ipynb)
